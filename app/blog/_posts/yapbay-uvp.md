TODO: review scenarios, add middling text, make it a cohesive whole.

1. Fiat to Fiat Remittances
2. Wizard
3. Sequential Escrow

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Remittance

Larry has 5,000 USD in a bank account in Miami.

Maria has a very small amount of COP in a bank account in Medellín.

Larry wants to send Maria 50 USD.

However, they do not want to use Western Union or any other legacy/TradFi remittance provider as it is slow, prone to delays, requires lots of paperwork, etc.

So Larry comes to my site, YapBay, and he finds a 2 offers to help him get the money to Maria.

He uses a wizard to build his transaction by chaining together the 2 offers.

Offer 1: Mike is based in the US. He can receive Larry's 50 USD in his US bank account and in return sell him 50 USDC.

This USDC should initially be escrowed by Mike.

Once Larry makes his fiat payment of 50 USD to Mike's bank account, Mike releases escrow.

However, now that USDC should immediately go into escrow with Andres so that he can confidently deposit his fiat payment of 50 USDC worth of COP (roughly 195,000 COP) into Maria's bank account.

Offer 2: Andres is based in Colombia. He can receive the 50 USDC and in return deposit 50 USD worth of COP to Maria's Colombian bank account.

This is basic use case of the YapBay platform.

### Scenario 2: Global Freelance Payment

Nina is a freelance web designer based in Manila, Philippines. She just got a client from London, Mr. Smith who is seeking to remit her payment for designing his business website. Mr. Smith agrees to pay Nina 750 GBP, but experiences problems with his traditional financial institution citing high foreign transaction fees and lengthy processing times. However, he discovers YapBay as a more efficient alternative.

He connects two offers on YapBay.
Offer 1: Paul, a UK crypto-enthusiast, can receive the 750 GBP in his UK bank account from Mr. Smith and he, in return, can sell Mr. Smith 750 GBP worth of USDC which will be escrowed.

Offer 2: Grace based in the Philippines is looking to sell her 750 GBP worth of USDC received from Paul, in exchange for depositing the equivalent amount in PHP (approximately 50,000 PHP) to Nina’s bank account in the Philippines.

This way, YapBay has managed to provide an efficient and cost-effective global payment method for freelancers like Nina and her clients.

### Scenario 3: Microloans for Small Businesses

Similarly, YapBay's blockchain platform can connect small businesses in developing nations who need access to credit with microloan providers in wealthier nations.

A small business owner Jose, in Chile, needs a loan of 1,000 USD to buy advanced farm equipment. Traditional lenders are hesitant due to Jose's location and lack of credit history.

Jack, who lives in New York, wishes to contribute to the economic growth of developing areas and is willing to loan the money to Jose.

In YapBay, Jack finds an offer from Alex, also in New York, who can take his 1,000 USD and in return, give him 1,000 USDC which then gets escrowed.

Then, Jack chains this offer with another offer from Sofia in Chile who can take the 1,000 USDC and deposit 1,000 USD worth of Chilean Pesos into Jose's business account.

With the money received from Sofia, Jose can purchase his equipment and make repayments over time, thus using YapBay to secure funding circumventing banking barriers.

### Scenario 4: Donation for Social Causes

Alice, based in Sydney, wants to donate 500 AUD to a non-governmental organization (NGO) conducting relief work in rural areas of India. Traditional money transfer services prove to be inefficient, costly, and time-consuming.

She finds two offers on YapBay to help her.

Offer 1: Ben in Sydney can receive Alice's 500 AUD in his Australian bank account and in return, sell Alice 500 AUD worth of USDC, escrowed by Ben.

Offer 2: Priya, in India, can receive the 500 AUD worth of USDC and in return, deposit the equivalent INR into the NGO's bank account in India.

YapBay thus breaks down barriers for international donations, making it easier for people worldwide to support the causes near and dear to their hearts.

### Scenario 5: Crisis Management During Forced Migration

During a socio-political crisis, SafeHaven - a non-profit organization based in Italy, is working to support refugees from the affected area. SafeHaven usually uses traditional channels to send money, which aren't functioning because of the shutdown of banks in the crisis area.

However, with YapBay, SafeHaven finds a more feasible solution.

Offer 1: Carlo in Italy, can receive the financial support fund from SafeHaven in his Italian account and in return, give SafeHaven an equivalent amount of USDC, which is then escrowed.

Offer 2: Mustafa, a businessman who manages to operate in the crisis-hit region, can receive the escrowed USDC from Carlo and in return, distribute local currency, or goods as needed, to refugees in the region.

This way, YapBay helps mitigate the impacts of crisis situations, ensuring essential funds reach where they need to go safely and quickly.

### Scenario 6: Accessing Mobile Money in Africa

George in Kenya is trying to pay for vital medical treatment for his father but finds it impossible with his limited access to banks. His friend Lucy, based in New York, offers to help.

She uses YapBay to make a remittance through mobile money, which is popular and widely used in many parts of Africa.

Offer 1: On YapBay, Lucy finds Daniel, a fellow New Yorker who can take her 200 USD and in return offer 200 USDC.

Offer 2: She then links to an offer by James in Kenya who can receive the 200 USDC and in turn deposit 20,000 Kenyan shillings (around 200 USD) into George's mobile money account.

Thus, YapBay allows for remittances using popular local payment methods in regions with limited banking infrastructure.

### Scenario 7: Circumventing Capital Controls

Anastasia in Greece wishes to move 1,000 EUR to her college-attending son, Dimitri in Germany. However, due to recently imposed capital controls, she is unable to do so through her bank.

She turns to YapBay to construct two chained offers.

Offer 1: Luke, a Greek resident unaffected by the restrictions, is willing to accept her 1,000 EUR and in return offer her 1,000 USDC.

Offer 2: Helmut in Germany will receive the 1,000 USDC and deposit 1,000 EUR into Dimitri's German bank account.

With YapBay, Anastasia can navigate around capital controls and make sure her son has access to funds for college.

### Scenario 8: Overcoming Limitations on Bank Withdrawals

After experiencing an economic crash, the government of Argentina has set a limit on bank withdrawals. Juan, a shopkeeper there, needs more funds than allowed to keep his business afloat.

His cousin Maria in Spain wants to help him with 2,000 EUR.

Maria finds two linked offers on YapBay.

Offer 1: Natalia in Spain can receive Maria's 2,000 EUR and offer her an equivalent escrowed USDC.

Offer 2: Pedro in Argentina will accept the escrowed 2,000 EUR in USDC and distribute an equivalent in Argentine Pesos to Juan's bank account, bypassing the withdrawal limit.

By using YapBay, Juan can keep his business running despite harsh economic conditions.

## Sequential Escrow

Sequential Escrow: In the scenario, the USDC should be initially escrowed by Mike (Offer 1) and then immediately go into escrow with Andres (Offer 2) after Larry makes the fiat payment to Mike's bank account.

Sequential escrow refers to a system where funds are released from one escrow and transferred into another as per the sequence of transactions happening between different parties involved. Sequential escrow chains have a particular order of operations that protect all parties involved in any transaction on the blockchain.

This system creates a trustless environment as each party is assured that their transaction is secured and they will receive their funds once they fulfill their part of the deal. This creates a natural order of operations that protects all members of the chain from potential fraud.

### Use case 1: Reducing Transaction Risks

In a multi-step transaction, risks come from the possibility of any party defaulting or falling short on their end of the bargain. However, with a sequential escrow, Jack sends his funds to Mike (Offer 1), who then sends it to an escrow account. Once the intended recipient confirms that they have received what was agreed upon, only then are funds released from the escrow to Mike. The same happens in Offer 2. This reduces transaction risks for all parties.

### Use case 2: Assures Parties in International Trade

In cross-border trade, payment terms can be different in foreign countries. Hence, when an entrepreneur is dealing with overseas clients or suppliers, they can utilize the sequential escrow system to assure other parties that their money is secure and will only be released once the agreed terms are met.

### Use case 3: Property Transactions

In property transactions, after a buyer and seller agree on a price, the buyer's funds are held in escrow. Then, the seller fulfills their obligations such as completing necessary paperwork. Next, these responsibilities shift to another party, maybe a real estate agent or a lawyer, to conduct necessary due diligence and ensure everything is in order. Only when every party fulfills all their obligations, do the funds move from one escrow account to the next, eventually releasing to the seller.

### Use case 4: Online Retail

In the e-commerce space, when a buyer orders from a seller, their funds go into an escrow account. Once the seller sends the product and the buyer confirms its receipt and satisfaction, the funds are released from escrow to the seller.

In conclusion, sequential escrow can be an integral part of executing complex, multi-step transactions in a safe and secure way that guarantees the satisfaction of all parties involved. Blockchain platforms like YapBay can significantly benefit from this system to ensure seamless and risk-free international transactions.

### Fiat to Fiat Conversion Wizard

The Fiat to Fiat Conversion Wizard, or F2F Wizard, is a unique value offering of the YapBay platform designed to facilitate streamlined cross-border fiat transactions leveraging blockchain infrastructure. As a comprehensive tool, the F2F Wizard guides users through the process of connecting distinct offers to accomplish a seamless currency transition from one country to another using crypto as the transport layer.

#### How it works

The Wizard gently asks end-users their source (starting) and their destination (ending) currency. Leveraging a sophisticated Pathfinding Algorithm, the F2F Wizard process optimally identifies the most efficient path(s) to convert the starting asset into the final one.

The Wizard achieves this by breaking down each step, detailing necessary per offer exchange rates and providing total fees (including those from the network and offers) required for the exchange. It displays the "amount-in and amount-out"–making it easier for users to understand the conversion rates and the potential value received.

#### Unique Features

1. **Interactive Interface**: The tool allows users to drag-and-drop offers, enabling them to create a transaction chain and mould it as per their requirements.
2. **Offer Filters**: Pro users of the platform can make use of an advanced feature to filter offers. This enables them to filter offers based on their choosing, say fiat currency, cryptocurrency, or the transaction amount.
3. **Saved Transactions**: For users with recurring payments, the wizard allows them to save chained transactions which then can be used as templates for their future use, saving valuable time and hassle by avoiding the need to build chains from scratch each time.

4. **Risk Assessment**: The Wizard offers an additional safety net by estimating a risk level or confidence score for each transaction based on the reputation of the transaction agents involved.

5. **Estimated Execution Time**: Giving a heads-up to manage expectations, F2F Wizard also anticipates the expected time duration needed for the successful execution of the total transaction.

#### Enhanced Name: Cross-Border Fiat Interchange Wizard

Your F2F Wizard is much more than just another blockchain tool - it revolutionizes the way individuals transact cross-border remittances by providing a seamless, reliable, and efficient medium to interchange cross-border fiat. Hence a more descriptive name could be "Cross-Border Fiat Interchange Wizard" or "Global Fiat Interchange Wizard". This not only gives it an innovative edge but also effectively communicates the central value proposition of the tool.

This digital assistant could represent a benchmark in disrupting an industry worth billions by introducing transparency, cutting back inefficiencies, and promoting more equitable access to global financial services.

0. "FIRE", standing for "Fiat Interchange & Remittance Enabler"?

1. **LEAP**: Liquidity and Exchange Automation Provider. This highlights the tool's ability to leap over barriers in traditional remittances.

2. **RISE**: Remittance and Interchange Solution Enabler. This acronym emphasizes the remittance function and the idea of enabling financial upliftment.

3. **BOLT**: Blockchain Operative Liquidity Transfer. This acronym suggests speed and efficiency in transferring liquidity across borders.
