# TODO

TODO: put navigation and the demo video on the app page

## 1. Trade Initiation and Acceptance:

1. Implement a mechanism for the offer owners to accept or reject the trade request. This can be done through email notifications, in-app notifications, or by providing a dedicated page for managing trade requests.

2. If both offer owners accept the trade request, update the trade status to "Accepted" and proceed with the escrow process.

3. Implement the escrow functionality to hold the traded assets (e.g., USDC) until the trade conditions are met. This can be done using a smart contract or a trusted escrow service.

4. Provide a way for the offer owners to confirm the receipt of the fiat payments (e.g., Larry's USD payment to Mike's bank account and Andres' COP deposit to Maria's bank account).

5. Once the fiat payments are confirmed, release the escrowed assets (e.g., transfer the USDC from Mike's escrow to Andres' escrow).

6. Update the trade status to "Completed" and notify all parties involved about the successful completion of the trade.

7. Display the trade status and details to the users on the trade initiation page or a separate trade details page.

- Trade acceptance page for offer owners to accept or reject initiated trades.
- Trade status tracking page showing the current status of ongoing trades.

## 2. Escrow and Payment:

- Escrow locking page for offer owners to lock the crypto amount in escrow.
- Fiat payment confirmation page for trade takers to mark the fiat payment as paid.
- Escrow release page for releasing the crypto to the trade taker upon successful trade completion.
- Escrow refund page for refunding the crypto to the offer owner in case of trade cancellation or timeout.

## 3. Trade Finalization and Dispute Resolution:

- Trade finalization page for offer owners to finalize the trade once the fiat payment is confirmed.
- Dispute initiation page allowing trade parties to raise a dispute in case of any issues.
- Dispute resolution page for admins to resolve disputes and make a decision.
- Dispute evidence submission page for trade parties to submit evidence supporting their case.

## The RAI: Remittance Acceleration Interface

> This connects 2 offers to permit a taker to move fiat currency in country X to fiat currency in country Y using crypto as a transport layer. So, this would connect an offer that sells fiat for crypto in country X with an offer to buy fiat in country Y with the crypto from the first offer.

- question: What asset are you starting with? What asset are you ending with?
- use algorithm to display paths: Pathfinding Algorithm: Implement an algorithm that identifies the most efficient path(s) for converting the initial asset into the final asset. Efficiency could be measured in terms of cost, speed, or a combination of factors defined by the user.
  - take a source currency and target currency and return a list of intermediate trades necessary for conversion
- breakdown each step
- per offer: show fees, exchange rates (sources)
- total: show total fees, both from offers and from network, KYC requirements
- amount in, amount out
- risk level / confidence score (based on reputations?)
- Estimated execution time
- Allow users to drag and drop offers to create a chain.
- Enable users to filter offers based on criteria such as fiat currency, crypto currency, and trade amount. (pro user mode?)
- Saved Transactions: Allow users to save chained transactions as templates for future use.
