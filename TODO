# TODO

1. grind on account
2. grind on offer
3. understand cross-contract stuff
4. Escrow, Arbitration, Reputation, Rating contracts.

## CONTRACTS: 
  - cross-contract interfaces @critical
  - research Common Contract Interface @critical
  - should there be an admin contract?? @critical
  - proxy pattern  @critical

### Account Contract @next

  1. In the `userReg` function, consider validating the input parameters to ensure they are not empty or invalid.

  2. In the `userUpdateProfile` function, consider adding a check to ensure that the user is updating their own profile or is an admin.

  3. In the `updateTradeStats` function, consider validating the input parameters to ensure they are valid and within expected ranges.

  4. Consider adding access control mechanisms to the `updateEndorsementsGiven`, `updateEndorsementsReceived`, `updateDisputesInitiated`, `updateDisputesLost`, and `updateTradeStats` functions to ensure that only authorized contracts or entities can call these functions.

  5. Consider adding a function to retrieve a user's reputation score directly, instead of relying on the `userStats` mapping.

  6. Consider adding a function to retrieve a user's basic information and stats in a single call, to reduce the number of external calls needed.

  7. Consider adding error messages to the `require` statements to provide more informative error messages.
