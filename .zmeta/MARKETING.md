## Elevator Speech (needs work)

Remittances today is a $700 billion industry with high fees, excessive paperwork and excessive identity requirements that people often can not meet or do not want to meet.

TradFi payment networks often don't talk to each other. Or, worse, they place obstacles to moving your money from network to another.

With YapBay, you put your TradFi accounts on-chain along with your preferred transaction parameters: amounts, buy and/or sell, times of day available, fiat pay/receive options, DM options, description of what is being offered, counterparty identity requirements, etc. You decide the conditions under which you participate in chained transactions.

When new orders come into the system that match an existing profile, notifications are sent, so transactions can be created.

The system traces a path and offers options, so it's like a complex order-matching system that mixes crypto and fiat to route around legacy TradFi payment network limits.

Users sending remittances and other cross-border payments assemble the available TradFi and crypto building blocks into the transactions they need, routing around capital controls, legacy TradFi payment networks and other obstacles to deliver funds for family support, business, to pay medical expenses, education expenses and to found new small enterprises.

YapBay enables users to create countless bridges with TradFi and Crypto to permit funds to go anywhere, from fiat to crypto and back again -- So everyone can onboard to crypto, spend crypto at merchants, save crypto, and exit to fiat when needed.
