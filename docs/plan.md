# YapBay Frontend Development Plan

- reduce debugging output
- Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?

## Fund Escrow

## Trade Progress
- progress bar busted in funded state. buyer has not been prompted to do anything so that is busted too

## API integration
- log in as user 3, create account
- migrate all old testing accounts to zen from brave, chrome, etc... also arbitrator address and yapbay funding address

## escrow
- mark fiat paid
- release escrow
- cancel escrow
- auto cancel
- event listener?
- error handling?

## Trade Page
- if I'm going to update via RPC on the state of the escrow at any given time, do I need listener? Do I need to be checking the API? Normalize that.
